C-extensions-to-extend-Ruby
===========================

Presentation which I gave at Josh Software on Open Source Friday.

ext/ contains two extensions which I have created for demonstration. One is to eject cdrom which includes 
one module `Demo`, one class `Eject` and one method `eject_cdrom` which ejects cdrom.

Other extension is to capture photo from any attached webcam which includes one class `Capture` and two methods,
 `list_devices` and  `take_photo`.

presentation/ contains index.html which is the slideshow.
